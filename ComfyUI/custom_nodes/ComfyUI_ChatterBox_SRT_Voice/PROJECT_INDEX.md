# ComfyUI ChatterBox Voice - Project Index

*Concise file index for reference - describes purpose and role of each file in the modular TTS/Voice system*

## Architecture Overview

This extension features a **modular multilingual architecture** that provides:
- **Smart Language Grouping**: SRT nodes process subtitles by language groups (Englishâ†’Germanâ†’French) instead of sequential order (1â†’2â†’3â†’4) to minimize model switching
- **Unified Engine Support**: Both F5-TTS and ChatterBox engines share the same multilingual processing core with engine-specific adapters
- **Comprehensive Caching**: Engine-specific cache key generation with global cache management for optimal performance
- **Character & Language Switching**: Advanced parsing supports `[character]` tags and language codes like `[de:Alice]` with automatic fallbacks
